# ML-Models-for-Predicting-Shear-Strength-of-CFS-Slotted-Channels

The Jupyter notebook contains nine optimized machine learning models for predicting the elastic shear buckling load and the shear strength of CFS slotted channels, including support vector machine regressor (SVR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), gradient boosting regressor (GBR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM),  gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost).
